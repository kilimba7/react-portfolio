# React Portfolio

  ## Description
  I recreated my portfolio from week 2 in hopes of improving performance and the UI. This was mainly possible because of the use of react.js in my application. My portfolio now offers a contact, about me, portfolio, and resume section where users can freely browse without having to completely refresh the browser. One of the challenges I had was being able to work conditional rendering, especially with some of the syntax in app.js.

  Hey Kilimba,


What we are missing, or otherwise could use some work on: Your UI's color scheme is quite dark, plain, and could use some contrasting colors that follow some sort of them. I am not the best with the design side myself, but I recommend you find a few different ones besides black with white text - try using CSS vars to set the colors & searching for a color scheming tool on "best-web-design-tools.com" or just Googling one! It would make it much more inviting and attractive to potential employers or clients. You are missing a Header component, in addition to your Footer component not appearing correctly across all pages. 


I recommend you checkout some more examples, such as on the "Awesome React" repo on GitHub, review the lessons, and read some docs & blog posts on React to get a better grasp on the reusable component philosophy. 



I make a "pages/" folder and use my components to build out the pages, bringing them all together in "app.js", which is a common pattern used by React devs!

 We could also be following some better practices here, such as in "App.js" your state vars are being passed into another state in the same component, which is just one example of how we could clean some things up a bit for a scalable solution. Don't be dismayed by this, though! 


Keep asking for help & put in as much time & effort into this as you can! Make sure you go to office hours, use learning assistance, or book a tutor if need be. We are here to help, and you can get React mastered! It's such an in-demand skill, and it's much easier than huge vanilla js web apps! Keep up the hardwork & communicate with your SSM! Thanks!
