# React Portfolio

  ## Description
  I recreated my portfolio from week 2 in hopes of improving performance and the UI. This was mainly possible because of the use of react.js in my application. My portfolio now offers a contact, about me, portfolio, and resume section where users can freely browse without having to completely refresh the browser. One of the challenges I had was being able to work conditional rendering, especially with some of the syntax in app.js.
